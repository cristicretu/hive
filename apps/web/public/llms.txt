# Hive

Hive is a CLI tool for managing parallel AI agent workspaces using git worktrees.

Hive simplifies parallel AI coding sessions by removing the complexity that developers face when running multiple agents. By eliminating branch conflicts and file stomping, it streamlines both implementation and maintenance workflows.

Built on git's [worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) feature and a beautiful [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) TUI, Hive ensures your AI coding sessions are both isolated and manageable by default.

For the source code, check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/cristicretu/hive).

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm i -g @cristicretu/hive-cli

# bun
bun add -g @cristicretu/hive-cli

# pnpm
pnpm add -g @cristicretu/hive-cli

# yarn
yarn global add @cristicretu/hive-cli
```

## Usage

Run `hive` in any git repository to launch the interactive TUI. Create isolated workspaces for each AI agent, then merge or drop changes as needed.

```bash
# Launch interactive mode
hive

# Create a new workspace
hive new "add user authentication"

# List all workspaces
hive list

# Merge a workspace back to main
hive merge my-task
```

## Why

Because alt-tabbing between branches is tedious and AI agents don't know how to share. [Anthropic recommends](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) using git worktrees for parallel Claude Code sessions—Hive automates the manual work.
